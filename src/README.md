-   **Loading State**: A loading animation is displayed while the page initializes.
-   **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth animations are used for various elements to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

-   **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
-   **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
-   **Framer Motion**: Animation library for React.
-   **Lucide React**: Icon library.
-   **Shadcn/ui (assumed)**: Based on the `components/ui` structure, likely used for pre-built UI components like `Button` and `Input`.

    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized version of the app in the `.next` folder.

## Deployment

This Next.js application can be deployed to various platforms. Vercel (from the creators of Next.js) is a highly recommended platform for seamless deployment.

1.  **Using Vercel CLI:**
    -   Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
    -   Deploy: `vercel`

2.  **Other platforms like Netlify or GitHub Pages** can also be used. Refer to their respective documentation for Next.js deployment. For GitHub Pages, you'll need to configure `next.config.js` for static export.

## Customization

-   **Countdown Target Date**: The countdown timer is initialized to 21 days from the first visit. This is managed in `src/app/page.tsx` within the `useState` hook for `targetDate`.
-   **Technologies List**: The list of technologies and their icons can be updated in the `technologies` object in `src/app/page.tsx`. Ensure new icons are added to the `public/icons/` directory.
-   **Styling**: Styles can be customized using Tailwind CSS classes directly in the components or by modifying `src/app/globals.css`.
